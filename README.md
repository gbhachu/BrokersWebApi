# BrokersWebApi
Tech-Test for Broker Insights

git-clone project to local machine: https://github.com/gbhachu/BrokersWebApi.git

Build and WebApi in Visual Studio 2019.

Package manager console: update-database to create database.

Start app in IIS express.

In Terminal window, navigate to Angular project folder and type: ng serve --0 --ssltrue.

Json has been created correctly and can be been by using postman sending get request to localhost/api/Clients/1.
Angular app however is not rendering bindings. This is my first attempt at using Angular and have found it impossible to debug 
issue using Visual Studio Code Editor.
